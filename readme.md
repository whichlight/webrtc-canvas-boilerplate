# webrtc canvas boilerplate

Code to get you started with pulling a webcam feed and processing it by
pixel.  Based on [this
example](https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/HTML-canvas-guide/PuttingVideoonCanvas/PuttingVideoonCanvas.html)

I knew I may try different effects and animations on processing the feed, so
this is just to avoid having to rewrite.
